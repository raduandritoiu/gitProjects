Do you mean when upgraded to android 2.2. It might be possible because it has around 500MHZ processor.
If you are looking for mobile phone which should support newer versions of android OS go for HTC desire.
According to its specs I think Desire should also support Android 3.0

It's good phone... for that price...sort of :) ...
For those complaining about power of the phone and not being in the Desire league... that's not this phone's intention... if desire Desire well go for it and buy one... not all of us want it or can afford it...

Yap thats a horrible CPU

and sure its not like the desire, it might looks abit like it but The CPU ,resolution ,screen size,Ram & rom
in the Desire r way much better , so for me this mobile looks like an android version of HD mini
nothing special on it ,

the Desire still Rocks the Most yet
