<p><em>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK  PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR  GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF  SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</em></p>
<p><em>1. Definitions</em></p>
<p><em>    1. &quot;Collective Work&quot; means a work, such as a periodical issue,  anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified  form, along with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and  independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work  that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as  defined below) for the purposes of this License.</em></p>
<p><em>    2. &quot;Derivative Work&quot; means a work based upon the Work or upon  the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical  arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound  recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in  which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that  constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the  purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a  musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in  timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered a  Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</em></p>
<p><em>    3. &quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or  entities that offers the Work under the terms of this License.</em></p>
<p><em>    4. &quot;Original Author&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity  or entities who created the Work.</em></p>
<p><em>    5. &quot;Work&quot; means the copyrightable work of authorship offered  under the terms of this License.</em></p>
<p><em>    6. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under  this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with  respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor  to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this  license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair  use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright  owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.</em></p>
<p><em>3. License Grant. Subject to the  terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,  royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable  copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</em></p>
<p><em>    1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more  Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective  Works;</em></p>
<p><em>    2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such  Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable  steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made  to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The  original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification  could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;;</em></p>
<p><em>    3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform  publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the  Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;</em></p>
<p><em>    4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform  publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission  Derivative Works.</em></p>
<p><em>    5. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:</em></p>
<p><em>         1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket  Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually  or, in the event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society  (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public  performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.</em></p>
<p><em>         2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory  Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually  or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),  royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (&quot;cover  version&quot;) and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17  USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other  jurisdictions).</em></p>
<p><em>    6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of  doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right  to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.  SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of  the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of  the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</em></p>
<p><em>The above rights may be exercised in  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights  include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to  exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly  granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</em></p>
<p><em>4. Restrictions. The license granted  in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following  restrictions:</em></p>
<p><em>    1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly  digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must  include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with  every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,  publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose  any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of  a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under  the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact  all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.  When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally  perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the Work  that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the  rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section  4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does  not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject  to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from  any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective  Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a  Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent  practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section  4(b), as requested.</em></p>
<p><em>    2. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally  perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as  defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1  above), You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep  intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium  or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,  if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor  designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing  entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in  Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the  name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent  reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor  specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the  copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with  Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of  the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by  Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original  Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in  any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work  or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all  contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as  part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for  the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use  the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the  manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may  not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship  or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as  appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express  prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution  Parties.</em></p>
<p><em>5. Representations, Warranties and  Disclaimer</em></p>
<p><em>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO  BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE  EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR  MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,  EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,  WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,  OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH  EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</em></p>
<p><em>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO  THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO  YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF  LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</em></p>
<p><em>7. Termination</em></p>
<p><em>    1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate  automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals  or entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above)  or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this  License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such  individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections  1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.</em></p>
<p><em>    2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here  is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work  under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;  provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this  License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted  under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force  and effect unless terminated as stated above.</em></p>
<p><em>8. Miscellaneous</em></p>
<p><em>    1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as  defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section 1  above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same  terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</em></p>
<p><em>    2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative  Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the  same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</em></p>
<p><em>    3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the  remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the  parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum  extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</em></p>
<p><em>    4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no  breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed  by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</em></p>
<p><em>    5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties  with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements  or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall  not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication  from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement  of the Licensor and You.</em></p>
